            The evolution of games has come aaaaaa fair way now from Mario and sonic on the Gameboy to AAA games such as Elden ring, sons of the forest, grand theft auto 5, Etc and over those years the generations of hardware and software have progressively increased such as Unreal Engine 5 which is currently the main game engine. On my website I'll be talking about the differences between old Gen games and current gen games by comparing them to their remake and using these main difference to compare them by, such as graphical difference , story difference and functional difference
