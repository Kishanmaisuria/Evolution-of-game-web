      <H2>Functions:</H2>
      <p>
        The games main functions are the same as the first they have added a feature where now you can levitate when there is no air but in the first game you could not levitate in any environment you could jump to other platforms but that’s about it.
        </p>
        <H2>Story:</H2>
      <p>
        The story fully stayed the same as the first one. The first Dead Space is story is about a massive deep space mining ship that goes dark after under earthing a weird artefact on a distant planet, engineer Isaac Clarke embarks on repair mission only to reveal the bloodbath of the ship’s crew that have been slaughtered by an infected alien scourge.
        </p>
        <H2>Graphical:</H2>
      <p>
        In the 2008 version of dead space uses Havok game Engine which is well known in the gaming industry  for having the BioShock , Elder Scrolls Skyrim , horizon zero dawn, Dark Souls ,demon souls and dead space series. The textures of Dead Space 2008 using the Havok game engine is very rough very gritty as the game steam is horror.  In the 2023 remake of the Dead Space, they use the frostbite game engine the phosphate engine is mainly recognised in the gaming community by Star Wars Battlefront 2, need for speed heat, battlefield 1 and FIFA 22. The textures of the 2023 remastered Dead space Are way more advanced the whole atmosphere of the game has changed as it’s no longer muddy vision is more of a foggy look ,a much darker tone.
